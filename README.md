# KayakApp

This is a Garmin Connect IQ application for kayaing (altough it uses ROWING and INDOOR_ROWING as sport profile).

I created this as a test app to track may Kayaking session, including the testing of what and how garmin records things in terms of strokes 
(the native app does not allow the use of external bike cadence sensor, only the watch's own internal accelerometer).

I am not sure if I will be further developing this, but there are concepts being used that may help other people with their own project :)
